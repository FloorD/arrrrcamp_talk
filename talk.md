##How to survive family gatherings and birthday parties as a Techie
**No dongle jokes were used for this talk.**

So, I get it. My sister and my cousin all studied Law, International Business, or something along those lines. I went to art school. My grandparents would ask me if I had any prospect on a job already (I worked next to my studies ever since I was 15, so much for that), and if I had a comfortable living in Rotterdam. My family is from 'another part' of the Netherlands and didn't necessarily have a positive view on Rotterdam. Dubbed the most criminal city of the Netherlands, I guess that's to be expected. But I guess that me being an 'artist' (and thus poor, right?) didn't help either. For the record: I studied graphics design, hardly considered free art. 
What I want to say with this rambling is that I understand where you are coming from, interacting with people that are not 'from our industry'. What are you supposed to talk about, if not about open source, rubies and the shittyness of JavaScript? Well...  

How does one explain to their grandparents what they do for a living? Or a potential love interest? With my talk I want to cut the crap, move past jargon and offer handy comparisons even your granny will understand. After this talk you'll (hopefully) be able converse about your favorite nerd topics with total noobs without having to explain yourself all the time.

I'd suggest subscribing to Skill Crush emails - you still have time to complete their 30-day email bootcamp before the holidays - or teaching at a beginners workshop like Rails Girls. They don't care about your favorite texteditor or os. God forbid, they might not even know what VC means. They will certainly not understand your 'hoon gelach' when they just shared how they built their website in Joomla or WordPress. 

##Hello, my name is Floor and [I'm dating a developer](http://datingadeveloper.tumblr.com)

He says the most amazing stuff. A selection:  

I like real time. It’s so fast.  
I consider my laptop both secure an compromised. It’s like Schrödingers Katze.  
I’m a binary shopper. It’s either a ‘yes’ or I hate it.  
There’s always something to google on the internet.  
I get my strong arms from typing on a Linux keyboard.  
So I added you to this git repository to manage things around the house, with grocery lists and stuff. It’s easier than using Google Docs.  

... and I'm unable to catch all the obscure Star Wars, Star Trek, Dune, whatever references as I enjoy those thing too - so they can't possibly be weird.  

Maybe you also found a partner in development (sounds wrong somehow) and you'll recognize these things - he/she:  
- uses IRC when you're in the same room  
- usually attends so few 'social' event people tend to think you have an imaginary boyfriend/girlfriend  
- only talks to strangers if they are developers too  
- fantasizing about replacing someone with a two liner  
- constantly suffers from the hackerpest  
- wears conference shirts, geeky shirts, shirts that were once black, but now different shades of grey only. 

##Cut the cr- lingo
Unraveling some terms we like to use,  

Teaching at Rails Girls events I know there is a fine line between 
you can't explain everything using everyday objects (think: cats), although sometimes it works. Describing scaffolding as the fundaments of a new building is correct and doesn't dumbs the action down.  

####Websites vs. web applications
Websites are static, meaning they are not updated, at least not all that often. When someone says “website” you should think simple, single page sites or marketing websites. Websites are built using HTML, CSS, and maybe a little bit of JavaScript. No programming language is required, and neither is a database.  
Like desktop applications (Word, Photoshop, Skype), web applications are dynamic and ever-changing. Web applications rely on you to interact with them, whether by contributing content (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook) or by gathering data from other sources and presenting it to you (Mint, Google Analytics, Klout) or a little bit of both!

When most people are talking about tech companies, they are usually talking about companies that create fancy custom web applications. Like everything on the web, Web applications are built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, but they also use programming languages like PHP, Ruby, or Python, and frameworks like Rails, Django, and CakePHP. Web applications almost always use databases, and because of that they are called dynamic.

####Back-end
Developers usually specialize in either frontend or backend technologies (not usually both) and many companies have frontend and backend teams, or even whole departments dedicated to either end!
The frontend is the part of a web site that you can see and interact with, while the backend is all the rest.

The backend is everything that happens before it gets to your browser. If you’re booking a flight, that’s where prices are checked, itineraries are booked, and credit cards are charged. A backend can be very simple or very complicated.

A typical setup for a backend is a web server, an application and a database. The web server delivers a note to the application that you’d like to see all of the flights to Chicago. The application looks up the flights in the database, puts together a web page that lists them, and sends that web page back to your computer through the web server. That’s all the backend. Once your computer gets a hold of it, it’s the frontend.

For technologies used in the backend, anything goes. If a database stores your name or flight info, it might be MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or many others. Web pages could be put together with Python, Ruby on Rails, or PHP. The web server that sends those pages over to your computer might be Apache, Nginx, or IIS. The list goes on and on!

##What ... thinks I do

####My mom
what I think I do - what ... thinks I do

So I asked my mom what she thinks I'm doing every day. My mom is fairly interested in (using) tech, as soon as it reaches a lifestyle status. WUT? She loves Twitter and somehow installed Tweetdeck on her laptop, and she has Facebook.com listed in her 'favorieten'. 
She follows [this guy](https://twitter.com/AlexanderNL), to get a hold of what's happening in the startup scene.

Het werk van een web developer.
Zodra de web developer op zijn of haar werkplek (ook wel "The Battleground") aankomt begint het onheil. Draken. Grote vuurspuwende draken met furieuze rode ogen met angstaanjagende tanden razen The Battleground op zodra de web developer inklokt met het Amulet der Wijsheid. Moet de web developer huiveren? Neen. Draken zijn dagelijkse kost. Maar draken komen natuurlijk zelden alleen, ze worden bereden door de Cyclopen van Zulugh N'darh. Gewapend met hun knotsen en geschreeuw vliegen zij op hun draken door de lucht (welke overigens immer groen is en tijdens werktijd van de web developer continu gevuld met hagel, bliksem en angstaanjagende donderklappen). Aan het einde van de dag, vaak vlak voor het uitklokken met het Amulet der Wijsheid, verschijnen er soms ook nog Goblins of Doom, Death Zombies en Schimmen uit De Vallei ten tonele. Naast dit alles komt het niet zelden voor dat er tijdens de vrijdagmiddagborrel een Ass Vampire op komt dagen.

De werkwijze van de web developer.
Tegen al dit kwaad is de web developer gelukkig bestand. De web developer heeft zich namelijk gespecialiseerd in het maken van de fijnste soorten webben om de vijanden te vangen. Zodra dit is gebeurd gebruiken zij spreuken uit mysterieuze virtuele boeken (bijvoorbeeld PHP, Visual C++ en Ruby on Rails) om de snoodaards en demonen te laten verdwijnen of in ijs of steen te laten veranderen. Waar de web developer het praktische werkt doet, krijgen zij hulp uit een andere hoek van de web desginer. Deze zorgt o.a. voor goede camouflage van de webben, zodat de vijanden makkelijker te vangen zijn. Ook produceren zij allerlei moois om de vijanden de webben in te lokken. Als laatste partij is er de usability expert. Deze richt zich vooral op de efficiëntie van de spreuken en webben. Deze moeten namelijk niet te ingewikkeld zijn omdat de vijand elk moment kan aanvangen. De usability expert controleert de web developer én de web designer op deze zaken. Samen vormen zij de Heilige Drie Eenheid van Inthergh Nerth.

Het werk van een web developer is belangrijk voor het voortbestaan van onze planeet en is nooit klaar.

Nooit.

##How to survive...

####Presents
Don't be the guy buying half-life 2 (or 3, I have no idea what iteration we're at) for your nephew, only so you can have someone to play with.
makey-makey to get your cousins interested in tech

####Human interaction

####A congener!
Given the situation that a new addition to the family is a programmer, even if he or she does not write elegant Ruby code, this is a blessing. PHP developer or not - they are gonna kill me for this at WordCamp this weekend - you both like to do stuff with code and thus allies. 

####Food
Bring some, as your family probably did not take all your allergies into account.  
Also: it's (probably) not pizza.

If you need help tackling any specific family problems, don't hesistate to ask me for advice at the after party. 

##Thank you.
