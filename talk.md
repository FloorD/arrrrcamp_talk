###How to survive family gatherings and birthday parties as a Techie


How does one explain to their grandparents what they do for a living? Or a potential love interest? With my talk I want to cut the crap, move past jargon and offer handy comparisons even your granny will understand.

#####Audience Takeaway
After this talk you can converse about your favorite nerd topics with total noobs without having to explain yourself all the time.

No dongle jokes were used for this talk.

So, I get it. My sister and my cousin all studied Law, International Business, or something along those lines. I went to art school. My grandparents would ask me if I had any prospect on a job already (I worked next to my studies ever since I was 15, so much for that), and if I had a comfortable living in Rotterdam. My family is from 'another part' of the Netherlands and didn't necessarily have a positive view on Rotterdam. Dubbed the most criminal city of the Netherlands, I guess that's to be expected. But I guess that me being an 'artist' (and thus poor) didn't help either. For the record: I studied graphics design, hardly considered free art. 
What I want to say with this rambling is that I understand where you are coming from, interacting with people that are not 'from our industry'. What are you supposed to talk about, if not about open source, rubies and the shittyness of JavaScript? Well...  


[I like real time. It’s so fast.][1]  
[I consider my laptop both secure an compromised. It’s like Schrödingers Katze.][1]  
[I’m a binary shopper. It’s either a ‘yes’ or I hate it.][1]  
[There’s always something to google on the internet.][1]  
[I get my strong arms from typing on a Linux keyboard.][1]  
[So I added you to this git repository to manage things around the house, with grocery lists and stuff. It’s easier than using Google Docs.][1]  

Uses IRC when you're in the same room  
Usually attend so few 'social' event people tend to think you have an imaginary boyfriend/girlfriend  
Only talk to strangers if they are developers too  
Fantasizing about replacing someone with a two liner  
Pen testing  
hackerpest  
conference shirts, geeky shirts, shirts that were once black, but now different shades of grey  

#####My mom
So I asked my mom what she thinks I'm doing every day. My mom is fairly interested in (using) tech, as soon as it reaches a lifestyle status. WUT? She loves Twitter and somehow installed Tweetdeck on her laptop, and she has Facebook.com listed in her 'favorieten'. 
She follows [this guy][2], to get a hold of what's happening in the startup scene.  


#####Presents
Don't be the guy buying half-life 2 (or 3, I have no idea what iteration we're at) for your nephew, only so you can have someone to play with.
makey-makey to get your cousins interested in tech
