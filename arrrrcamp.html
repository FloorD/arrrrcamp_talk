<h2>How to survive the holidays as a Techie</h2>
<h3 style="color:silver;">No dongle jokes were used for this talk.</h3>

So, I get it. My sister and my cousin all studied Law, International Business, or something along those lines. I went to art school. My grandparents would ask me if I had any prospect on a job already (I worked next to my studies ever since I was 15, so much for that), and if I had a comfortable living in Rotterdam. My family is from 'another part' of the Netherlands and didn't necessarily have a positive view on Rotterdam. Dubbed the most criminal city of the Netherlands, I guess that's to be expected. But I guess that me being an 'artist' (and thus poor, right?) didn't help either. For the record: I studied graphics design, hardly considered free art. 
What I want to say with this rambling is that I understand where you are coming from, interacting with people that are not 'from our industry'. What are you supposed to talk about, if not about open source, rubies and the ... existence of JavaScript? Well...  

With my talk at Arrrrcamp on the subject I wanted to cut the crap, move past jargon and offer handy comparisons even your granny will understand. With the goal that all attendees would (hopefully) be able converse about their favorite nerd topics with total noobs without having to explain themselves all the time, just by being a bit more descriptive.

Do you want to polish your family proof tech chat? I'd suggest subscribing to Skill Crush emails - you still have time to complete their 30-day email bootcamp before the holidays - or teaching at a beginners workshop like Rails Girls. They don't care about your favorite texteditor or os. God forbid, they might not even know what VC means. They will certainly not understand your 'hoon gelach' when they just shared how they built their website in Joomla or WordPress.

... and he says the most amazing stuff. A selection:  

<ul>
<li>I like real time. It’s so fast.</li>
<li>I would like to see the kids of this shit. (the children of an element)</li>
<li>I'm not a VCS. (answer to 'you silly git')</li>    
<li>I consider my laptop both secure an compromised. It’s like Schrödingers Katze.</li>  
<li>I’m a binary shopper. It’s either a ‘yes’ or I hate it.</li>  
<li>There’s always something to google on the internet.</li>  
<li>I get my strong arms from typing on a Linux keyboard.</li>  
<li>So I added you to this git repository to manage things around the house, with grocery lists and stuff. It’s better than using Google Docs.</li>  
</ul>

... and I'm unable to catch all the obscure Star Wars, Star Trek, Dune, whatever references as I enjoy those thing too - so they can't possibly be weird.  

<h3>Cut the cr- lingo</h3>
Let's unravel some of the terms we like to use, as there not very noob-friendly. 

Teaching at Rails Girls events I know there is a fine line between explaining something in a way a beginner can understand it - and making something unnecessarily abstract.  
You can't explain everything using everyday objects (think: cats), although sometimes it works. Describing scaffolding as the fundaments of a new building is correct and doesn't dumbs the action down.  

<h4>Websites vs. web applications</h4>
Websites are static, meaning they are not updated, at least not all that often. When someone says “website” you should think simple, single page sites or marketing websites. Websites are built using HTML, CSS, and maybe a little bit of JavaScript. No programming language is required, and neither is a database.  
Like desktop applications (Word, Photoshop, Skype), web applications are dynamic and ever-changing. Web applications rely on you to interact with them, whether by contributing content (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook) or by gathering data from other sources and presenting it to you (Mint, Google Analytics, Klout) or a little bit of both!

When most people are talking about tech companies, they are usually talking about companies that create fancy custom web applications. Like everything on the web, Web applications are built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, but they also use programming languages like PHP, Ruby, or Python, and frameworks like Rails, Django, and CakePHP. Web applications almost always use databases, and because of that they are called dynamic.  

<h4>We're bootstrapping</h4>
You're paying for stuff with your own money. End of story.  

<h4>Give me ALL the octocats</h4>
You are using a version control system to make a virtual backup of your application. But honestly, why would you tell this to your uncle in accounting at a christmas get-together - to get back to the subject of this talk?!  

<h4>Back-end</h4>
Developers usually specialize in either frontend or backend technologies (not usually both) and many companies have frontend and backend teams, or even whole departments dedicated to either end!
The frontend is the part of a web site that you can see and interact with, while the backend is all the rest. There are hundreds of different programming languages, and they all make you type different things to get the same result. 

<h4>Open Source</h4>
You started something, figured out that you can't make money with it and then threw it in a corner of the Internet - for others to fix its bugs. KIDDING. You are a collaborator at heart and you believe that world-changing - scratch that - useful software should be build transparently and freely available. 

<h4>Cyber security</h4>
There are very few people who have an idea about what the whole NSA, PRISM 'thing' actually entails. And even if they have an idea, the responses usually vary from "I have nothing to hide, so I'm goooood" to the perception that it's a downright outrage that we can punch in all this personal information to vouch for the use of free services and then get spyed on. Who would have thought, right?!  
Once you get started talking about this subject - although it might not be the best conversation starter - people are very grateful if you can help them with simple hacks to ensure their safety and (perceived) privacy online. 

<h3>What's up with job titles nowadays?</h3>
Some of the terms regularly used in job offerings in tech these days:  
<ul>
<li>senior - although 3 years of experience often seems enough to earn this badge.</li>   
<li>rockstar - "a rockstar can do the work of 10 regular developers". Bullshit, no-one can.</li>  
<li>ninja - a ninja usually specializes in different fields of interest, but correct me if I'm wrong. Additionally, if you have a strict policy on being-present-during-office-hours, you might have a slight problem.</li>  
<li>guru - gross.</li>   
<li>wizard - pret-ty exclusive, huh? No wonder your dev team is 100% white male.</li>  
</ul>

<h3>... and that's coming from a 'developer evangelist'</h3>

I started programming august last year. I had been working as a community manager for 5 years and being an art school graduate, I missed 'making stuff'. The social yellow pages startup I worked for at the time allowed me to work closely together with the dev team. Not that that was all that easy. Although I was one of only 15 employees - and managing 5 of them being head of community management - the gap between marketing and communications and the developers seemed 'unbridgeable'. As some of the attendees might know, working for a startup means you have a lot of responsibilities. A coworker that used to do some recruitment in her days might take on HR next to her day job as a marketeer and the developer who had done quite some stuff for advertising agencies is in charge of all things design. Being interested in tech topics and able to pick up on slang relatively fast (a trick that came with my job) the developers quickly adopted me as a somewhat equal in their discussions. I quickly learned how to write bug reports in a way to avoid 'I can't reproduce this, therefor there is no bug'.  
This was around the time that our company adopted this theory of 'constant hackweek'. As a result our developers would be working on new awesome features - that I would then eagerly translate in to normal-human-language for our blog - rather than on fixing existing bugs. Now as a community manager you're dealing with the users of your service or product on a hourly basis. So I'd hear from my team what feature was lacking or was even throwing a huge error. As people associated me personally with the service I'd get somewhat angry direct messages urging to go and 'talk to the engineers'. Instead of doing that however, I decided to learn Ruby (on Rails), so I could fix them myself. Or at least go as far as figuring our what the problem could be and suggest a solution.  

I started with studying the Rails Girls guides and attempted to master the terminal and Git with a good friend and coworker. Having had experience with CSS, HTML and even a bit of PHP, learning Rails seemed to be not a too big of a deal. Defending why I'm coaching at an co-organizing Rails Girls events and not Java Girls or Go Girls (other than that it just sounds wrong) my answer would always be that Rails is fairly easy to read and understand. Which is a great first step.
In December I subscribed to this Ruby off Rails course, for I wanted to learn more about the language behind the framework. As of January I spend all my weekends in the local hackerspace rebuilding a guilt website for this online game Rift from scratch, together with another Ruby rookie, who attended DevBootcamp in SF. Our mentor is again an ex colleague of mine, who devotes his FREE time teaching two quite stubborn newbies the ins and outs of his favorite programming language.
In my adoptive hometown (Vienna) I started co-organizing WordPress meetups and Ruby meetups (vienna.rb) to contribute to the local community of developers. It has been a very satisfying experience. I like meeting and connecting like-minded people and as far as the Ruby meetups concerned, I think it's a healthy thing for the attendees as well, to leave their desks or attics for once and meet peers and interesting companies and get to hear some great talks about how other people deal with the recent security issues in Rails, for example.
I also have a day job by the way, I 'do' developer evangelism, translating code documentation in common people - scratch that - user-language and feature requests to dev speak.  


<h3>What ... thinks I do</h3>

<h4>My mom</h4>
So I asked my mom what she thinks I'm doing every day. My mom is fairly interested in (using) tech, as soon as it reaches a lifestyle status. WUT? She loves Twitter and somehow installed Tweetdeck on her laptop, and she has Facebook.com listed in her 'favorieten'. 
She follows this <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderNL" target="_blank">guy</a>, to get a hold of what's happening in the startup scene.  

My mum basically thinks I organize meetups with sponsored drinks, so I can get the attendees drunk and agree to use - sratch that - buy my application. 

<h4>My friends</h4>

I asked the same question to one of my friends and he wrote this saga:

The moment the web developer arrives at her workspace (aka The Battleground) the trouble starts. Dragons. Big, firespitting dragons with eyes red of fury and teeth the size of trees - big pointy trees. They rush to the battleground as the web developer punches his Amulet of Wisdom. Do we see the web developer shiver? Not really. Dragons are a common sight on the battleground. But dragons seldom operate alone. Cyclops of Zulugh N'darh, armed to the bone, drive these dragons, screaming their awful scream. Unbothered by the green skies, filled with lightning and thunder, Goblins of Doom, Death Zombies and shadows of the shire join them, just before the web developer clocks out his amulet of wisdom at the end of the day. Danger lurks even at the TGIF, taken the form of vampires.
The web developer is immune to this danger as she specialized in making the finest of webs to catch these monstrous creatures. As she catches them, she uses magic spells from mysterious virtual books (like PHP, C++ or Java) to make them dissapear or to change them into stone or ice. Although the web developer takes care of all the practical stuff, she gets help from the web design corner. These people take care that the webs are beautifully camouflaged, to fool the monsters. And they add niceties to lure them in. Then there's the usability expert. He focusses on the efficiency of the webs. In case of sudden danger, the webs need to be created fast. The usability expert keeps the web developer and web designer agile, together they are the Holy Trinity of Intergh Nerth. The work of a web developer is crucial for this planet and will never be done. Never.   

I don't know where exactly I fit in, but it's shocking how accurate his description of our world is. 

<h4>I, myself</h4>
I like to think that, with organizing developer meetups, I get programmers to leave their desks for a bit to interact with other developers, find likeminded people and make beautiful things happen. You know, rainbows, unicorns, Care Bears, the whole shebang.  

<h3>How to survive...</h3>

But back to the topic of the talk. 

<h4>Presents</h4>
Don't be the guy buying half-life 2 (or 3, I have no idea what iteration we're at) for your nephew, only so you can have someone to play with.
Buy a Makey-Makey to get your cousins interested in tech. You can hook up a Makey-Makey to everyday objects like tomatoes, a pencil drawing or buckets of water (true story) and make keystrokes, or play Tetris. Get them a Raspberry Pi, if they are more advanced (disclaimer: I tried this on my dad, the Makey-Makey was significantly more succesful).   
Mark (the dude behind boston.rb) told me that he has bought domain names for his relatives. Though this seems like a great last minute plan - one hour before dinner is served on Christmas eve - it will probably not work out as hoped. Not everyone wants their firstname-lastname registered as a domain, they might want something a little funkier. But more importantly, once they have a domain name, they probably want a website. Who do you think they are going to call?  

<h4>Ermagherd! Another programmer!</h4>
Given the situation that a new addition to the family is a programmer, even if he or she does not write elegant Ruby code, this is a blessing. PHP developer or not - they are gonna kill me for this at WordCamp this weekend - you both like to do stuff with code and thus allies. 

<h4>Turn of your devices</h4>
as that will allow you to fully practice...  

<h4>...Test Driven Interaction.</h4>
